				Ok, this is going to be embarrassing
			</h1>

			<p>
				You see, this is the download page for my project, <strong>Von
				Neumann Defense Force</strong>. I've already spent a
				considerable amount of time on it, but it is still <strong>not
				nearly ready</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				But guess what, who cares if it isn't? I certainly don't!
				Who doesn't like a bit of <strong>public embarrassment</strong>
				from time to time?
			</p>

			<p>
				But seriously, this is why it isn't ready yet:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I looks like shit.
				</li>
				<li>
					It doesn't work half of the time.
				</li>
				<li>
					When it does work, it only runs on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, 64
					bit).
				</li>
				<li>
					It doesn't do a whole lot.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				You don't care? You're so excited about this silly project, you
				still want to see it? Ok then, in that case why don't you just
				go and
