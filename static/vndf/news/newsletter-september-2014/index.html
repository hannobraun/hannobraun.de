							Neumann Defense Force</em>. This month:
							<a href="http://www.eveonline.com/" target="_blank">EVE Online</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#developmentupdate">Development Update</a>:

						</li>

					<h1>Inspirations: EVE Online</h1>

					<p>
						Even those that have never played it might have heard
						stories about <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/" target="_blank">EVE
						Online</a>. Stories like
						<a href="http://eve.klaki.net/heist/" target="_blank">the devastating
						heist by GHSC</a> which required months of undercover
						work,
						<a href="http://www.wirm.net/nightfreeze/part1.html" target="_blank">the
						great scam</a> (probably fiction, but still a good
						example of the kind of things that can happen in EVE),
						<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/28/5352774/eve-online-wages-largest-battle-in-its-10-year-history" target="_blank">huge battles</a> involving thousands of players
						and much, much more.
					</p>

					<p>
						I played EVE many years ago, and at its best, it's a
						great game. Captivating, dramatic, and filled with many
						memorable moments. Its huge world, the seemingly endless
						possibilities, the moments of victory and loss, of
						camaraderie and betrayal, make for a game that can
						swallow you up for months or even years.
					</p>

					<p>
						Even today, I like to think back to some of the great
						times I had with this game: Hunting with friends for
						hapless victims, fighting for our lifes when it turned
						out those victims had backup. Battles that were barely
						won, wars that were devastatingly lost.
					</p>

					<p>
						But EVE also has a dark side: Mind-numbingly boring
						busywork is required to pay for all the fun times. The
						seemingly endless potential of its world is crippled by
						huge swaths of high-security space, where a majority of
						its players hide away from the ups and downs that the
						rest perceive as the whole point of the game.
					</p>

					<p>
						Add to that developers that seem only interested in
						extending the game, piling ever more features and
						content on top, making the game more and more complex,
						and leaving older features, once introduced with the
						promise of great potential, to wither and die.
					</p>

					<p>
						I haven't played EVE in years. Much of what I criticize
						might have been improved. From what I hear, at least the
						neglect of existing features has gotten better. Still,
						as much as the idea of EVE still fascinates me, I know I
						won't be able to stomach its downsides for long, so I
						won't be going back.
					</p>

					<p>
						Back when I played it, I often thought about how EVE
						could be fixed, how what is great about it could be
						captured, while leaving all the problems behind. After
						all these years, I think I might have found an answer:
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Don't get me wrong. <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>
						isn't aspiring to be a clone of EVE, nor even very
						similar to it. It will be a simpler game, much more
						focused, and less compromised. But I certainly hope that
						its players will experience some of the joy that I felt
						while playing EVE Online, without having to bear too
						many of the downsides.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						So, what happened since the last <em>VNDF</em>
						newsletter? Let's start with my plans form
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-august-2014/" target="_blank">the last
						newsletter</a>:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Clean up the graphics code and evaluate the
							<a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs" target="_blank">gfx-rs</a>
							library as a replacement for OpenGL.
						</li>
						<li>
							Start converting the game back to 3D.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Yet again, this was exactly what I did. I can't help but
						notice that announcing my plans in public seems to have
						a positive effect on my ability to get them done.
					</p>

					<p>
						I rewrote all the graphics code using gfx-rs, and I
						couldn't be happier about it. Compared to raw OpenGL,
						gfx-rs is easier to understand and work with. It's much
						harder to make mistakes with, but still flexible enough
						to do anything I need. Going forward, this will make
						working with anything graphics-related much easier than
						it would have been otherwise.
					</p>

					<p>
						Figuring this stuff out took most of the month, but I
						still had some time left afterwards to work on changes
						that are actually visible to the user (and not only of
						help to my development efforts). I promised screenshots,
						so here they are:
					</p>

					<a class="image" href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014/vndf-old.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014/vndf-old.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						This is what <em>VNDF</em> looked like a month ago. The
						triangle in the middle represents the player's ship. In
						the background is a 2D grid that helps visualize the
						ship's movement.
					</p>

					<a class="image" href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014/vndf-new.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014/vndf-new.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						And here is the current state. As you can see, the image
						now has some depth to it. You can also zoom and rotate
						the view. There are a still a few problems that need to
						be fixed, but it's a good step forward.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what's up for next month? Well, now that the bulk of
						the graphics work is done, the next priority is the
						gameplay.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							First up is 3D movement: While the graphics are 3D,
							ships are still only capable of moving in a 2D
							plane. This is the next thing I'll be working on.
						</li>
						<li>
							After that, I'll work on making the movement more
							realistic. Right now ships just move with a constant
							speed in whatever direction they currently face. I
							want to make this more realistic, implementing
							proper Newtonian mechanics.
						</li>
						<li>
							Since I don't expect the previous two items to take
							very long, I also planned a bigger task for the
							coming month: Adding a planet to the game. I expect
							to have some first results by the next newsletter,
							but it'll be a while until the planet is fully
							integrated and interacts with ships in the way I
							intend it to.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						Yet again, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space and gaming-related news from around the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						NASA has
						<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol3773" target="_blank">
						successfully reformated the flash memory</a> of its
						11-year-old Mars rover, <strong>Opportunity</strong>. I
						can't help but think about how much computer-related
						things go wrong here on Earth. Reformatting and
						successfully restoring a computer that is many millions
						of kilometers away, with no one there to push the reset
						button, seems like a pretty impressive feat!
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>India's Mars Orbiter</strong> is just a few days
						away from <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mars-mission-300-days-on-23-more-days-to-go/1/380496.html" target="_blank">
						reaching the red planet</a>. Even if this mission
						probably isn't ground-breaking in the big scheme of
						things, it's great to see a newcomer arrive at Mars.
						It'll be exciting to see what the next decades of space
						exploration will be like, with more countries taking an
						active role.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>A nice picture</strong>:
						<a href="http://kokogiak.com/solarsystembodieslargerthan200miles.html" target="_blank">All
						known bodies in the solar system with a diameter larger
						than 200 miles</a>.
