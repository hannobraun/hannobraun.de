				<h1>Von Neumann Defense Force is On Hold</h1>
			</header>

			<article>
				<p>
					Hi everyone. You may have noticed that I've stopped sending newsletters a long time ago, or maybe you've forgotten that the project existed in the first place.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm sorry for being silent for so long. I should have written this message many months ago. I kept putting it off. At first because I wasn't sure what to write, later because I was embarrassed about putting it off for so long. Better late than never, I suppose.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here's the situation: Both Chris and I have stopped working on the project around December 2015. Back when it started to happen, I wasn't sure if it was a temporary lull. Later it became very clear that it was permanent.
				</p>

				<p>
					I could write a lot about the reasons, but in the end it comes down to this: Von Neumann Defense Force was a huge effort, and even though I had high hopes for a while, there never was a great chance of any return, financial or otherwise. I still wanted to do it though. I wanted to work on it, because I knew a game like this needed to exist.
				</p>

				<p>
					But at some point, I lost that sense of purpose. That question, why this game needs to exist, I can no longer answer it. Without that answer, there's no point in continuing.
				</p>

				<p>
					I won't try to speak for Chris and his reasons here, but I'd like to take the chance to thank him publicly. When he joined, the project was already in a bit of a lull. He brought with him a whole new momentum. His work was not only immensely valuable on its own, it also gave a huge boost to my motivation and inspired me to step up my game. He's also a great guy to work with. Thank you for everything, Chris.
				</p>

				<p>
					So that's it. Feel free to stay subscribed to this list. If anything happens to the project, I'll be sure to tell you. I wouldn't hold my breath, though. Thanks to all of you for your interest and support. I wish you all the best.
				</p>

					Hanno
