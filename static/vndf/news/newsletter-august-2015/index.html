					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						Those last few weeks have been productive ones, and a
						lot of visible progress has been made. I can't take
						credit for all of that though, as another developer has
						recently joined the VNDF team!
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's dive right into what happened since the last
						newsletter:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#introducing-chris-gill">Introducing Chris Gill</a>:
							For the first time ever, a second developer has
							joined the team.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#cli-improvements">Another Round of CLI Improvements</a>:
							It just won't stop: The command-line interface has
							gotten better yet again.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#ui-improvements">User Interface Improvements</a>:
							The user interface has been improved, and a lot of
							information that was previously only available via
							the CLI has been moved to the graphical interface.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#window-resizing">Window Resizing</a>:
							The game window can now be resized, and it actually
							works like you'd expect.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#better-physics">Better Physics</a>:
							The navigation work that begun a few months ago
							keeps moving forward ever so slowly.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#ipv6-support">IPv6 Support</a>:
							The VNDF website and the game itself can now be
							accessed with the new version of the Internet
							Protocol.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically? Please

					<h1>Introducing Chris Gill</h1>

					<p>
						I'm excited to introduce a new member of the Von Neumann
						Development Team: Chris Gill
						(<a href="https://github.com/viperscape" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
						<a href="https://twitter.com/_scape" target="_blank">
							Twitter</a>)!
					</p>

					<p>
						Chris has been a reader of the VNDF newsletter for a
						while, and offered his help after the
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-july-2015/" target="_blank">
							July newsletter</a>.
						I'm very happy to have Chris on board, and he already
						did a lot in his first month, as you'll see throughout
						the rest of this newsletter.
					</p>

					<p>
						Doubling the team size from 1 to 2 has required some
						adjustments, as communication and project management can
						no longer happen just inside my head, but the transition
						has been remarkably smooth. I'm looking forward to keep
						working with Chris, and I'm excited to see what we'll be
						able to do over the next few months.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="cli-improvements"></a>
					<h1>Another Round of CLI Improvements</h1>

					<p>
						The command-line interface has proven very valuable
						since its introduction. As I hoped, it allowed me to
						prototype new features with minimal effort on the UI
						side.
					</p>

					<p>
						As one of his first tasks, Chris went to work on adding
						new useful features to the CLI. By pressing the
						<code>up</code> and <code>down</code> keys, you can now
						navigate through the history of previous commands. It
						has also become possible to edit a command using the
						usual keys used for text editing (<code>Left</code>,
						<code>Right</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>End</code>,
						<code>Delete</code> and <code>Backspace</code>).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="ui-improvements"></a>
					<h1>User Interface Improvements</h1>

					<p>
						Being able to quickly prototype features is all very
						well, but eventually, established features need to be
						moved to the graphical part of the user interface. This
						was another area that Chris focused on over the last few
						weeks, with great success. Among other improvements, a
						lot of information that was previously only accessible
						from the command-line interface is now visible in the
						graphical interface:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							A ship's id is now displayed above the ship.
						</li>
						<li>
							The navigation data (position and velocity) of each
							ship is displayed next to it.
						</li>
						<li>
							The ship's current velocity is also displayed as a
							straight line originating from the ship. Eventually,
							we hope to extend this into a full-blown course
							prediction, taking scheduled maneuvers and gravity
							by celestial objects (which aren't in the game yet)
							into account.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a ship is sending a broadcast message, it is
							visible below the ship.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ships are now color-coded. The player's own ship has
							a different color from other ships, making it easier
							to make sense of what's going on.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, the camera now follows the player's ship,
							so you can no longer lose your own ship because it
							flew out of the screen.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Here's a screenshot that shows off all those
						improvements:

				<section>
					<a name="window-resizing"></a>
					<h1>Window Resizing</h1>

					<p>
						It has long been possible to resize the game's window,
						but now, thanks to Chris, it actually works correctly.
						The game will use all the available space to render its
						graphics.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-august-2015/screenshot-maximised-window-4k.png"
						target="_blank">

							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-august-2015/screenshot-maximised-window-4k.png"
							alt="The game window running maximised on a 4k monitor" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					This is the game with a fully maximised window on the new 4k
					monitor I have in my office. This actually showcases another
					problem, as the text and symbols are way too small at this
					resolution, but one problem at a time.

				<section>
					<a name="better-physics"></a>
					<h1>Better Physics</h1>

					<p>
						Navigating through space has become better yet again:
						Since
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-july-2015/" target="_blank">
							last month</a>,
						it's possible to schedule multiple maneuvers in advance.
						Now, those maneuvers no longer change the ship's
						velocity instantly. Instead, they apply a thrust in the
						direction of the maneuver over time, like, you know, a
						real space ship would.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="ipv6-support"></a>
					<h1>IPv6 Support</h1>

					<p>
						As technically inclined computer users are likely to
						already know, the currently dominant version of the
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol"
							target="_blank">
							Internet Protocol</a>,
						IPv4, will no longer provide enough addresses to connect
						all the devices to the Internet that will require
						connecting in the future. I've made sure that Von
						Neumann Defense Force will keep working by adding
						support for IPv4's successor, IPv6.
					</p>

					<p>
						This also solved some problems that occured when players
						were already connected via IPv6. From now on, both
						versions of the protocol should work smoothly.
					</p>
