					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#article">Public Service Announcement</a>:
							This month, I'm announcing some changes to the
							newsletter format.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#news">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take an interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!
					</p>

					<h1>Public Service Announcement</h1>

					<p>
						As you may know, I failed to write
						<a
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-february-2015/#article"
							target="_blank">
							last month's newsletter article</a>.
						I've been thinking about how to handle this in the
						future and have come to the conclusion that this article
						is not important enough to delay the newsletter for or
						to take away too much of my limited development time.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the future, there won't always be an article. I will
						write one whenever there's something special to write
						about or when I have a good topic, but I'll not worry
						too much about it when that isn't the case.
					</p>

					<p>
						To compensate, I decided to try and be a bit more
						detailed in the
						<a href="#update">Development Update</a>. Starting this
						month, I also began experimenting with a slightly
						different format for the update.
					</p>

					<p>
						That's all for now. Enjoy the rest of this newsletter!

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<section>
						<h1>Flying Through Space</h1>

						<p>
							<a
								href="/vndf/news/newsletter-february-2015/#update"
								target="_blank">
								Last month</a>,
							I announced I was going to work on adding more
							features to the game, and so I did. After a rather
							large amount of work on the user interface and a
							comparatively tiny amount on the actual feature,
							ships have a position again.
						</p>

						<a
							class="image"
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-march-2015/screenshot-position.png"
							target="_blank">
							<img src="/vndf/news/newsletter-march-2015/screenshot-position.png" />
							<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
						</a>

						<p>
							So far, this is very simplistic. Each ship has a
							position and a velocity. The position is updated
							regularly and sent to the ship's owner (the player).
							That's it, there's no way to influence the position
							or see the position of other player's ships as of
							yet. I originally had planned to do much more in
							this, but I got distracted by...
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Another Secret Project</h1>

						<p>
							Yes, again. This time I had an idea about how I can
							make <em>VNDF</em>'s user interface more attractive
							without necessarily increasing the amount of work
							required to implement it. All I'm going to say about
							it now is that it's some kind of fusion between the
							old graphics-based concept and the new text-based
							user interface.
						</p>

						<p>
							I've already been working on this for a few weeks,
							and I'll keep doing so for a few more. By the time
							the next newsletter rolls around, I should have
							something to show for my efforts. You'll hear all
							about it then!
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Server Maintenance</h1>

						<p>
							A word of advice for those not interested in server
							administration: Skip this section, it won't be very
							interesting to you.
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>, both the
							<a
								href="http://vndf.de"
								target="_blank">
								website</a>
							and the game prototype (the one
							<a href="/vndf/newsletter">newsletter subscribers</a>
							have access to) are hosted on the same server,
							together with a few of my other websites. I'd been
							unhappy for a while about how all of this was set up.
						</p>

						<p>
							I'm running all of this on the cheapest virtual
							server available from
							<a
								href="http://hetzner.de"
								target="_blank">
								Hetzner</a>,
							and since today's cheapest server is slightly
							cheaper and much more powerful than the one from
							last year (when I ordered my server), I decided it
							was time to replace it with a new one and, while I'm
							at it, set that one up in a way that's more to my
							liking.
						</p>

						<p>
							The old server was running
							<a
								href="http://ubuntu.com"
								target="_blank">
								Ubuntu</a>
							and used
							<a
								href="http://docker.io"
								target="_blank">
								Docker</a>
							to provide some degree of isolation between the
							different services running on the machine. I kind of
							like the concept behind Docker, but not so much the
							implementation. It had been causing me some trouble
							from time to time, and I had wanted to replace it
							with something more light-weight for a while.
						</p>

						<p>
							The good thing is, Docker isn't made out of magic.
							It just exposes some features that the underlying
							Linux kernel has anyways. As it turns out, I can
							access those features more directly via
							<a
								href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/"
								target="_blank">
								systemd</a>,
							and since it, - or something comparable to it - is
							running on my system anyway, why not make use of it?
						</p>

						<p>
							Ubuntu is currently in the process of switching to
							systemd, but hasn't finished doing so yet. Since I
							assume that it'll be quite a while before systemd is
							supported in a stable manner, I decided to switch to
							another operating system for my server. The choice
							fell on
							<a
								href="https://www.archlinux.org/"
								target="_blank">
								Arch Linux</a>,
							which has been shipping with systemd for quite a
							while.
						</p>

						<p>
							So that's what I used. I'm very pleased with how
							this has turned out, and so far the new server has
							been running without any problems. That said, Arch
							isn't a very traditional choice for a server. I
							certainly hope that I won't regret that decision.
						</p>

						<p>
							And yes, I remember that I said I needed to work on
							the website. That's still and issue, but I decided
							to do the server maintenance first, so I can build
							on a more solid foundations with the website
							changes.

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the Internet.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>Dawn Arrives At Ceres</h1>

						<p>
							Finally,
							<a
								href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-spacecraft-becomes-first-to-orbit-a-dwarf-planet/"
								target="_blank">
								Dawn has arrived at Ceres</a>.
							It's currently in a high orbit on the dwarf planet's
							dark side. Dawn will emerge on the light side in
							mid-April, and we can expect increasingly better
							images from then on, as the spacecraft transfers to
							increasingly lower orbits.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Moon Discoveries</h1>

						<p>
							Lots of moon news this month!
							<a
								href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/spacecraft-data-suggest-saturn-moons-ocean-may-harbor-hydrothermal-activity/"
								target="_blank">
								Enceladus' subsurface ocean may feature
								hydrothermal acticity</a>
							and
							<a
								href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-s-hubble-observations-suggest-underground-ocean-on-jupiters-largest-moon/"
								target="_blank">
								a subsurface ocean may have been discovered on
								Ganymede</a>.
							It would be really great if the space-faring
							countries could transfer some of their military
							budget into space exploration. There are so many
							exciting places to visit, and at the current rate
							it will take ages until all of them have been
							thoroughly explored.
