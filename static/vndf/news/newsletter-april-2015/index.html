					<h1>The Best of Both Worlds</h1>

					<p>
						For a single person with limited time and resources, a
						project like <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> is lots
						of work. For that reason, I always try to think of ideas
						that can ease the workload and help me arrive at my
						eventual goal faster and more efficiently. Once in a
						while, that thinking leads to a radical shift in the
						direction of development.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of these shifts happened a few months ago: I decided
						to do away with the 3D interface I was working
						on at the time and shift to a mostly text-based
						interface that would use graphics only sparingly, where
						they were most needed and useful.
					</p>

					<p>
						While I still think this was the right decision at the
						time, I've had some new insights since then and that
						gave me an idea for a better approach to the user
						interface. Before I present that new approach to you,
						let me tell you about these insights.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Insight 1: I need to let go of 3D gameplay (for
							now)
						</h1>

						<p>
							Even after switching away from 3D graphics, I still
							held on to the idea of 3D gameplay. <em>Von Neumann
							Defense Force</em> is going to be a game based on
							realistic orbital mechanics. I strongly believe that
							for this kind of game a third dimension adds a lot
							of tactical possibilities. Turning this into a 2D
							game would take away a lot of that depth.
						</p>

						<p>
							Still, there are more important priorities. Getting
							out a playable prototype is more important than
							anything else right now. Once I have reached that
							goal, I can keep improving the game and add all
							kinds of crazy features later.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the end, I realized that switching to a far less
							attractive approach to the user interface while
							holding on to a feature (3D gameplay) that isn't
							even making good use of that interface doesn't make
							any sense. I'm going to have to let it go for now.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Insight 2: Rendering simple 2D graphics is
							relatively easy
						</h1>

						<p>
							Once I had realized I was going for 2D gameplay (at
							least initially), I had another realization: 2D
							graphics are easy, as long as you keep them simple.
							What can make them complicated is building a
							non-trivial user interface on top of them.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Putting 1+1 together: A hybrid interface</h1>

						<p>
							From these two insights came another thought: What
							if I could somehow make use of simple 2D graphics,
							while handling complex user interaction in some
							other way? Then it dawned on me: I could use
							traditional 2D graphics to render information that
							lends itself to it, like the positions of player's
							ships, while using a text-based interface for all
							other interaction with the user.
						</p>

						<p>
							This approach allows me to quickly prototype new
							features with the text-based interface and migrate
							features that work out to the graphical interface
							later. Even more, if the text-based interface
							becomes more of a trial ground for features that are
							in development instead of the primary mode of
							interaction with the user, I can radically simplify
							it, saving a lot of work on that front.
						</p>

						<p>
							So what does that look like, exactly? Well, most of
							the screen is used for displaying graphical
							information, like other player's ships. In addition,
							there's a command-line interface in the corner that
							enables you to get more information about the game
							state and give commands to your ship. For example,
							you could type something like
							<code>list-broadcasts</code> to see a list of all
							communications sent by other players.
						</p>

						<p>
							Here's a screenshot from the current development
							version:

						<h1>Conclusion: Project management is hard</h1>

						<p>
							While I think it's great that I found a new approach
							that will, in my opinion, both save work and
							increase the game's visual attractiveness, this also
							demonstrates a problem. I can't keep changing
							directions endlessly. Even if every new approach is
							an improvement long-term, it makes a lot of previous
							work useless and puts me back significantly
							short-term. I think this is demonstrated by the fact
							that I didn't make a lot of forward progress since I
							started the newsletter last year. In fact, the game
							made steps backwards and is looking significantly
							less developed than it did months ago.
						</p>

						<p>
							I think this underlying problem is caused by two
							main failings on my part. The first is being
							overly optimistic. When I started this newsletter in
							July last year, development had been going really
							well for a while. I thought it would just keep going
							like this, and that I would make a great deal of
							progress in no time.
						</p>

						<p>
							Of course, that's not how things worked out. I have
							other things going on in my life, and the time and
							energy I can invest into <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em> varies considerably. I really think I
							have learned my lesson here and will be far more
							cautious with my plans in the future.
						</p>

						<p>
							The second failure was being too sure about my
							decisions instead of taking them for what they were:
							Ideas that showed promise but still needed to be
							proven.
						</p>

						<p>
							Both when I
							<a
								href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2014"
								target="_blank">
								switched to 3D graphics</a>
							and when I
							<a
								href="/vndf/news/newsletter-january-2015"
								target="_blank">
								scrapped that and introduced a text-based
								interface</a>,
							I thought this was it. This was going to be the new
							direction for the foreseeable future. Both times I
							went into it too deep and did a lot of work that was
							later thrown away.
						</p>

						<p>
							I think these situations could have been handled
							more efficiently if I could have seen those ideas
							for what they were: Prototypes that had to be
							validated -or invalidated- with the least possible
							amount of work.
						</p>

						<p>
							I think this is a trickier problem to fix, as it can
							be difficult to step back and take an objective look
							when you're right in the middle of things. None the
							less, I'll try and do my best here. And while I
							certainly hope that this is the last word on the
							user interface for a while, a lot of new challenges
							will be coming up in the future, giving me ample
							opportunity to prove I've learned from my past
							mistakes.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<section>
						<h1>New Project Management Tool</h1>

						<p>
							Keeping up to date with what's happening -and about
							to happen- in the project is very important, and
							since paper gets unwieldy very fast, software is the
							solution to that particular problem. I had been
							using
							<a
								href="http://pivotaltracker.com"
								target="_blank">
								Pivotal Tracker</a>
							for project management, and while it's a fine tool,
							it's also very opinionated. As my process kept
							evolving, the tool served me less and less well.
						</p>


						<p>
							Enter
							<a
								href="http://trello.com"
								target="_blank">
								Trello</a>.
							Everyone who's used Trello knows that it's the Excel
							of web applications. It's extremly flexible and can
							be used to organize all kinds of situations, from
							appartment searches to software development
							processes. Knowing that, I set out to create a
							Trello board that captures my process perfectly.
						</p>

						<a
							class="image"
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-april-2015/screenshot-trello.png"
							target="_blank">
							<img
								src="/vndf/news/newsletter-april-2015/screenshot-trello.png"
								alt="The Trello board I use for VNDF development" />
							<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
						</a>

						<p>
							I really like this new setup. I have two lists,
							<code>Ideas</code> and <code>Roadmap</code>, for
							high-level concepts that are not perfectly planned
							out yet. Detailed tasks start in <code>Ready</code>,
							when they're ready to be worked on, and move over
							<code>In Progress</code> to <code>Finished</code>,
							giving me a good picture of what's going on. Once
							finished work has been deployed to the live server
							(available to <a href="/vndf/newsletter">newsletter
							subscribers</a>), they move into the
							<code>Live</code> list for that calendar week.
						</p>

						<p>
							All in all, this new system gives me a very good
							overview over both what's going on and what's
							planned for later. I'm very happy about how it
							turned out!
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Hybrid Text/Graphical User Interface</h1>

						<p>
							I've already written all about this in
							<a href="#article">this month's article</a>, so
							there's not much left to say here. Most of the time
							was spent was setting up the basic building blocks
							required to render graphics and fixing some problems
							that arose from that.
						</p>

						<p>
							There was one really crazy (and in retrospect
							really obvious) bug that caused some input events to
							go missing. This almost drove me crazy and cost me
							the better part of a week to fix, but now things are
							working fine (mostly).
						</p>

						<p>
							None of this is really exciting, but I feel it forms
							a solid foundation to build upon. Let's see what the
							next few months will bring.

								SpaceX managed to land a rocket on a tiny barge</a>
							in a huge ocean, with a rocket that just returned
							from a suborbital trajectory. Now, it wasn't exactly
							a soft landing and that rocket certainly won't be
							reused, but still. It's only a matter of time now
							until they get it right.
