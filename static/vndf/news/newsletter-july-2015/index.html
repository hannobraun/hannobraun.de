					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						After development activity took a bit of a dive in April
						and May, the upwards trend that started in early June
						has been continuing. I've managed to establish a new
						schedule, and while things are not exactly moving at
						record speed, steady progress is being made.
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's take a look at what's new since the last
						newsletter:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#seeing-other-players">Seeing Other Players</a>:
							Players were able to interact by sending broadcast
							messages, but they weren't able to see each other's
							positions. That has changed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#more-cli-improvements">More CLI Improvements</a>:
							Work on the command-line interface has continued,
							and some small improvements have been made.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#scheduling-maneuvers">Scheduling Maneuvers</a>:
							Last month saw the introduction of the navigation
							feature. Now players can schedule multiple maneuvers
							that are executed after a delay.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#more-cleanup">More Cleanup</a>:
							Cleanup work has been ongoing, this month with more
							of a focus on the core game code.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!
					</p>

					<h1>Seeing Other Players</h1>

					<p>
						Sending text broadcasts to each other is no longer the
						only method for players to interact within the game.
						While everyone had been able to see their own ship's
						position for quite a while, players couldn't see each
						other.
					</p>

					<p>
						Of course, such a thing is quite important for a
						multiplayer game, so I decided to add it in, before
						continuing with the navigation work.
					</p>

							alt="Multiple player ships next to each other" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Right now it's quite hard to tell who is who, but as
						always, this is a work in progress and things will
						improve.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="more-cli-improvements"></a>
					<h1>More CLI Improvements</h1>

					<p>
						The command-line interface has received further
						improvements, most notably a help command!
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-july-2015/screenshot-help-command.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img
							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-july-2015/screenshot-help-command.png"
							alt="Output from the help command" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						By typing <code>help</code>, you can display a list of
						all available commands and the arguments they require.
						Another improvement are negative angles for the
						<code>schedule-maneuver</code> command (so you can say
						-90° instead of 270°) and a bug was fixed that prevented
						the confirmation message from being printed in some
						situations.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="scheduling-maneuvers"></a>
					<h1>Scheduling Maneuvers</h1>

					<p>
						Executing maneuvers has been possible for a few weeks
						now, but now it's possible to schedule several of them
						in advance, having them executed at a time of your
						choice.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far, all of this is done via the command-line
						interface, but eventually there will be a graphical
						interface for this feature. I imagine a system somewhat
						like the
						<a
							href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node"
							target="_blank">
							maneuver nodes</a>
						in
						<a
							href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com"
							target="_blank">
							Kerbal Space Program</a>,
						but we'll see what I can come up with.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name="more-cleanup"></a>
					<h1>More Cleanup</h1>

					<p>
						The server-side code cleanup has continued. This month,
						I focused more on the core game logic and the handling
						of game data. This is not exciting work and it doesn't
						lead to results that can be shown off, but it is
						necessary, as it keeps the code from degrading over time
						and keeping it easy to work with.
					</p>
