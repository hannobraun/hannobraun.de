					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						It's been a bit of a crazy month. Chris has gone on a
						rampage, implementing about a million different
						features, while I filled more of a supporting role:
						Giving guidance and feedback, documenting game design
						concepts, working on tools, and so on. It's been an
						interesting adjustment and is something that can't
						really be avoided when switching from working alone to
						working in a team. Still, I'm hopeful that I'll get to
						do a bit more development work in the near future.
					</p>

					<p>
						But without further ado, let's take alook at what
						happened since the last newsletter:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#planets-and-a-grid">Planets and a Grid</a>:
							What's a space game without planets? Not a lot. Good
							thing Chris is on the case.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#camera-controls">Camera Controls</a>:
							It's now possible to control the camera in various
							ways.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#hidpi-support">Support for HiDPI Displays</a>:
							Support for displays with high pixel density has
							been added.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#game-design">Game Design</a>:
							I've begun the somewhat painful process of
							transcribing ideas and concepts that so far only
							lived inside my head.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#smooth-ship-movement">Smooth Ship Movement</a>:
							No more jumping from place to place every 0.5
							seconds, as the server sends new position data:
							Ships now move smoothly.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#easier-chatting">Easier Chatting</a>:
							Talking to your fellow players, while still a bit
							rough, has become a lot easier.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically? Please
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">let me know</a>!

					<h1>Planets and a Grid</h1>

					<p>
						A few weeks back, when taking a look at the new changes,
						I could barely recognize the game anymore. Chris,
						awesome as he is, had added planets to the game, as well
						as a background grid to help with orientation.
					</p>

					<a

						<img
							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2015/screenshot-planets.png"
							alt="A ship in front of a bunch of planets" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Obviously this is only a first step (for one, we won't
						have multiple planets on top of each other in the final
						version), but it's a good start and a basis for further
						development.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name="camera-controls"></a>
					<h1>Camera Controls</h1>

					<p>
						For a while now, the camera has been following the
						player ship, keeping it in the center of the screen.
						While this is slightly better than the player ship
						disappearing out of the screen as it keeps moving, it
						was still quite basic. Chris has followed up and
						implemented more advanced camera controls.
					</p>

					<p>
						It is now possible to select any ship, or even groups of
						ships, using the mouse or the command-line interface.
						The camera will follow the selected ships. You can
						select ships by clicking on them, drag-selecting them
						(like you would do in a real-time strategy game) or by
						using the <code>select-entity</code> and
						<code>clear-selection</code> CLI commands.
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition, you can zoom the camera, using the mouse
						wheel or by holding down Tab and pressing Page Up/Page
						Down.
					</p>

					<h1>Support for HiDPI Displays</h1>

					<p>
						I got a new monitor in my office a while ago, which was
						a big change from the tiny laptop display I had been
						using previously. After going nearly blind from staring
						at the tiny text (the new monitor's pixel density is
						much higher than my old one's), I decided it was time
						for a change and added an option to scale up the size of
						all the graphics.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you too have a high DPI monitor (remember,
						<a href="/vndf/newsletter">newsletter subscribers</a> get
						access to the game), just create a file called
						<code>client-config.toml</code> in the game directory
						and add the single line
						<code>scaling_factor = 2.0</code> to it (you can adjust
						the actual value to suite your own display and taste).
					</p>

					<p>
						Sorry for all the manual steps. I plan to ship a fully
						documented configuration file with the game, but
						haven't gotten to it yet.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="game-design"></a>
					<h1>Game Design</h1>

					<p>
						For most of my time working on the project, I didn't
						write down a lot of the design I had in mind for the
						game. This was fine previously, but with Chris on board,
						the lack of common vision had turned into a problem.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've started the slow and tedious process of putting my
						vision into writing, which turns out to be hard work.
						After thinking about the game for so many years, it is
						quite challenging to write material that would be useful
						for a newcomer. Still, I'm off to a good start and I
						believe it has been helpful so far.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you've found this project within the last few months,
						you might be interested in some of the material I've
						written for the first few newsletters:
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-august-2014/#vision" target="_blank">
							An article about the game's vision</a>,
						as well as a series of articles about games that
						inspired Von Neumann Defense Force:
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014/#inspirations" target="_blank">
							EVE Online</a>,
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2014/#topic" target="_blank">
							Kerbal Space Program</a>,
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-november-2014/#topic" target="_blank">
							DayZ</a>, and
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-december-2014/#topic" target="_blank">
							FTL</a>.

					<a name="smooth-ship-movement"></a>
					<h1>Smooth Ship Movement</h1>

					<p>
						While aiming to be a tense and sometimes action-packed
						experience, Von Neumann Defense Force is not really
						meant to require fast reactions. The intended slow-paced
						gameplay is very much reflected in the technical
						infrastructure, as the server only sends new information
						to the client every 500 milliseconds.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far this meant that the graphics would also only
						update twice a second, which was, of course, quite
						ridiculous. Chris came to the rescue and taught the
						client to extrapolate the position of all ships based on
						the last available information, making for a smooth
						experience.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="easier-chatting"></a>
					<h1>Easier Chatting</h1>

					<p>
						VNDF aims to be a multiplayer game, but the means to
						communicate with other players are limited so far. While
						we're busy working on other features, the current
						broadcast system will have to do for a while, but Chris
						has implemented an awesome stopgap: Received broadcasts
						are automatically printed to the console, providing a
						basic chat history. Until we have time to add a proper
						chat system, this will hopefully keep players from being
						too lonely.
