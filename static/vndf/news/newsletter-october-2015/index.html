					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						The last few weeks have been kind of a mixed bag. First
						Chris got busy, but I hit my stride and got a lot done,
						so it kind of evened out. Then I got busy, too, and
						basically nothing happened for two weeks. Still, some
						things got done, and the game has made some visible
						progress compared to last month!
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's get right into it:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#planet-generation">Planet Generation</a>:
							Instead of generating a bunch of planets on top of
							each other, we now have some more realism.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#navigation">Navigation</a>:
							Work on the navigation feature has been ongoing for
							months now. Finally it has reached a state that can
							be considered feature-complete!
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#collisions-and-gravity">Collisions and Gravity</a>:
							Some interactions between ships and planets have
							been added to the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>:
							A documented configuration file is now being shipped
							with the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#under-the-hood">Under the Hood</a>:
							Some improvements have been made under the hood to
							make development more smooth.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically? Please

					<h1>Planet Generation</h1>

					<p>
						Last month,
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2015/#planets-and-a-grid" target="_blank">planets
						made their way back into the game</a>. Since then, we
						improved the way they are generated and positioned.
						Things are a bit more realistic, closer resembling what
						a planet with some moons would look like.
					</p>

						<img
							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2015/screenshot-planets.png"
							alt="A planet with moons" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Of course, that screenshot demonstrates the next
						problem: When you zoom out far enough to actually see a
						few moons, they are so small you can barely make them
						out. Space is big, but a solution will find its way into
						the game eventually.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name="navigation"></a>
					<h1>Navigation</h1>

					<p>
						It's been a while since I
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-june-2015/#navigation" target="_blank">started
						working on the navigation feature</a>, and I'm proud to
						say I finally finished implemented everything I wanted.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've added an additional argument to the
						<code>schedule-maneuver</code> command, to allow players
						to set the thrust of a maneuver. In addition, there's
						now a <code>list-maneuvers</code> command, to list all
						scheduled maneuvers, as well as a
						<code>cancel-maneuver</code> command to cancel one.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2015/screenshot-maneuvers.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img
							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2015/screenshot-maneuvers.png"
							alt="A list of scheduled maneuvers" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Work is currently ongoing to show the predicted path of
						the player's ship, based on the maneuver information
						that is available now. In addition, once the navigation
						feature has stabilized a bit (we might still change it
						here or there), we can start displaying the scheduled
						maneuvers graphically and introduce a user interface for
						setting them up without using the console commands.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="collisions-and-gravity"></a>
					<h1>Collisions and Gravity</h1>

					<p>
						Now that we have planets again, it would be a shame not
						to do something with them. This is why I implemented
						both gravity and collision detection. In addition, I
						changed the spawn point for ships to a spot a few
						hundred kilometers above the planet's surface.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2015/screenshot-gravity.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img
							src="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2015/screenshot-gravity.png"
							alt="A space ship, not far from a violent death" />
						<p>(click to see full size)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Since the ship's initial speed is not high enough for it
						to stay in orbit, you can watch it slowly plunge to a
						certain death, which is strangely satisfying. I'm sure
						it will get old soon, though, and I'll have to implement
						some new features to entertain me. Oh well.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name="configuration"></a>
					<h1>Configuration</h1>

					<p>
						Last month, I
						<a href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2015/#hidpi-support" target="_blank">introduced
						the new configuration file</a>. As of today, a
						documented example file ships with the game to make this
						feature more accessible.
					</p>

					<p>
						Remember, <a href="/vndf/newsletter">newsletter
						subscribers</a> get a download link for the Linux
						version of the game.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="under-the-hood"></a>
					<h1>Under the Hood</h1>

					<p>
						There are constantly small cleanups being made, to make
						the code more solid and easier to work with. This month,
						two stand out: Game event validation and code generation
						for the entity system.
					</p>

					<p>
						The code that validates game events on the server side
						has been refactored to be more robust and secure. This
						is very important, as there's always the potential for
						abuse in a multiplayer game. For example, players can
						cancel scheduled maneuvers. Imagine if this wasn't
						validated properly, and player's could cancel the
						scheduled maneuvers of other players. Or, even more
						hilariously, since canceling a scheduled maneuver
						technically means removing an entity from the game,
						imagine if players could misuse that to remove any
						entity from the game, like planets or each other's
						ships.
					</p>

					<p>
						The second improvement is code generation for the entity
						system. An entity system (or entity-component-system,
						short ECS) is basically a way to organize game data and
						game logic. We've been using a homegrown one for a
						while, but a lot of that code had become repetitive, and
						thus error-prone. Now the code that handles game data,
						which previously had to be maintained manually is being
						generated from a simple specification, making it much
						easier to handle.
