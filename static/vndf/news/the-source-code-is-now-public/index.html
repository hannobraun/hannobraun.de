				<h1>The Source Code Is Now Public</h1>

					Hello everyone. It's almost been a year since development on Von Neumann Defense Force stopped, and a few months since I announced that fact officially.
				</p>

				<p>
					Abandoning a project that you've put so much work and passion into is never easy or pleasant, I guess. But sometimes it just can't be helped, and if that's the case, you might as well make the most of it.
				</p>

				<p>
					For that reason, the source code for Von Neumann Defense Force is now <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf">publicly available</a>, for everyone to read, use, or ignore as they please.
				</p>

				<p>
					We hope that the code will be useful, or maybe entertaining, to some of you out there.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hanno
