					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						As the title says, this has been a rather uneventful
						month. I've recently picked up a new client (I'm working
						as a freelancer) and am still adjusting to my new
						schedule. Still, I made some progress. Here's what's
						been going on this month:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#new-format">New Newsletter Format</a>:
							As part of my ongoing quest to make the success of
							this project a realistic prospect, I've decided to
							cut back the time I spend on the newsletter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#logging">Logging Infrastructure</a>:
							I've been hunting for a persistent bug that's been
							eluding me for a while. Better logging should help
							me out.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#small-fixes">Small Fixes</a>:
							A few small annoyances have been fixed.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>New Newsletter Format</h1>

					<p>
						Von Neumann Defense Force requires a lot of work, and
						the time I can spend on it is finite. Cutting back the
						project's scope to make it more manageable has been an
						ongoing concern for a while now.
					</p>

					<p>
						<a
							href="http://www.vndf.de/news/newsletter-march-2015/"
							target="_blank">
							A few months ago</a>,
						I announced that I wasn't going to write a new article
						for every single newsletter any more, since that had
						been the most difficult and time-consuming part of it.
						From this month on, I'm cutting out the articles for
						good. In addition, the news section at the end is also
						gone.
					</p>

					<p>
						This reduces the newsletter to its core: The development
						update that let's you, the readers, know what's going on
						month to month. I hope you're okay with this change, but
						whether you like it or not, please
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">let me know what you
						think</a>!

					<a name="logging"></a>
					<h1>Logging Infrastructure</h1>

					<p>
						One thing that's been ongoing for a while now is the
						hunt for a very persistent bug: From time to time, I was
						logging into my server to find that VNDF going wild,
						using 100% of the CPU. This has only been happening very
						rarely, and thus has been difficult to diagnose.
					</p>

					<p>
						In order to help find this bug, and other similar ones
						in the future, I've been adding a proper logging
						infrastructure using
						<a
							href="https://github.com/rust-lang/log"
							target="_blank">
							log</a>.
						This means that the server process will now print out
						messages for almost everything it does. Different log
						levels are used to make it quite easy to see exactly the
						information that is needed to diagnose a problem and
						filter out the rest.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far I haven't found my bug yet, but it's good to have
						this around none the less.
					</p>

				<section>

					<h1>Small Fixes</h1>

					<p>
						The introduction of the new
						<a
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-april-2015"
							target="_blank">
							hybrid interface</a>
						also brought a few new problems. Among those: Some key
						presses (Backspace and Return) were registered twice and
						players no longer had their own comm id displayed to
						them.
					</p>

					<p>
						The first problem was a straight-forward bug fix. The
						second was solved by introducing a new command: Players
						can now see their own comm id with the new
						<code>comm-data</code> command.
					</p>
