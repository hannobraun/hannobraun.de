					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Inspirations: DayZ</a>: In this
							third part of our series about games that inspired
							<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>, I'll talk about
							a game I never actually played:
							<a href="http://dayz.com/" target="_blank">DayZ</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>Inspirations: DayZ</h1>

					<p>
						Today's article in the inspirations series will be a bit
						different. The previous two months, I talked about
						<a
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-september-2014#inspirations"
							target="_blank">
							EVE Online
						</a>
						and
						<a
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2014#topic"
							target="_blank">
							Kerbal Space Program</a>,
						games I spent a large amount of time with. Today I'll
						talk about a game I haven't played at all:
						<a href="http://dayz.com/" target="_blank">DayZ</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						My first contact with DayZ came in the form of articles
						I read back when the game (then actually as a mod for
						<a href="http://www.arma2.com/" target="_blank">
							Arma 2</a>)
						started making waves. I tried to find out more about it
						on YouTube, and while I'm unsually not into "Let's Play"
						videos, I quickly got hooked on watching videos of
						people playing DayZ.
					</p>

					<p>
						What I saw made a big impression on me: The bleak,
						post-apocalyptic scenario; a largely empty world, dotted
						with interesting things to find (like useful equipment);
						the constant zombie threat, always prompting you to stay
						quiet and on the move; and, especially, the occasional
						group of other players, who might turn out to be great
						allies or deadly menace.
					</p>

					<p>
						In DayZ you start with nothing. Powerless, vulnerable,
						and, unless you quickly find supplies, soon to be
						starving. Over time, if you manage to evade the many
						dangers, you will find weapons, equipment, food and
						drink, maybe even a working vehicle. All of this can
						give you confidence and a way to protect yourself
						against the world's many dangers, but you need to stay
						alert: A single wrong decision or maybe just a moment of
						bad luck, and you could lose it all in an instant.
					</p>

					<p>
						With this constant danger, every decision becomes
						interesting. In another game, crossing a meadow might be
						an ordinary thing to do. In DayZ, you never know if a
						sniper might hide in that building over there, part of
						an ambush prepared by other playing looking to steal
						your valuable gear.
					</p>

					<p>
						DayZ, being a first-person shooter with a contemporary
						and realistic setting, will look very different from
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>, a space-based
						multiplayer game focused on small-scale strategy.
						However, I hope to translate the elements of DayZ that I
						described in this article into this new setting,
						creating a game that is just as tense, just as
						enganging, and of course just as fun to watch YouTube
						videos of.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						Leading up to
						<a
							href="/vndf/news/newsletter-october-2014"
							target="_blank">
							last month's newsletter</a>,
						I had some of the most productive weeks in the project's
						history. Compared to that, this month's progress was
						sure to disappoint, and so it did. Due to a variety of
						factors, I wasn't able to work as much on <em>Von
						Neumann Defense Force</em>. Still, some work got done,
						and more fruitful times will surely return soon.
					</p>

					<p>
						As a reminder, here's what the game looked like a month
						ago.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-november-2014/screenshot-old.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img src="/vndf/news/newsletter-november-2014/screenshot-old.png" />

					</a>

					<p>
						And here's a screenshot from this month.
					</p>

						class="image"
						href="/vndf/news/newsletter-november-2014/screenshot-new.png"
						target="_blank">

						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<ul>
						<li>
							See that blue thing that helps with orientation?
							Remember how I didn't know what to call it last
							month? Well, you, the audience, heard my request for
							help and I was informed that, of course, this is
							called the nav disc. Thanks, Martin! (You might
							argue that this isn't really a change to the game
							and that I'm trying to pad this list. You
							<em>might</em> be right.)
						</li>
						<li>
							A line is drawn from each object in space to the nav
							disc, making it much easier to judge where they are.
						</li>
						<li>
							There's a helpful line that indicates the direction
							your ship is moving in. It doesn't account for
							gravity yet, so it's usefulness is a bit limited.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Together, these changes already make it easier to judge
						where things are and how you're moving in relation to
						them. There's still a lot to do though. The next step is
						going to be to refine these features, mainly by
						predicting a proper course that accounts for the
						influence of gravity.

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						A few months ago, I started an effort to play every game
						I owned on Steam at least once. Thanks to the Humble
						Bundle (which I've become very critical of, but that's
						a topic for another day, I guess) I have over a hundred
						games in my Steam library, most of which I had never
						played. I've liked a lot of the games I played so far,
						but one stood out above all others:
						<a
							href="http://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/"
							target="_blank">
							To The Moon</a>.
						I'm not going to say much about it, except that you
						should all go play it, right now. It's a masterpiece.
					</p>

					<p>
						How could I write this month's newsletter without
						mentioning the landing of the <strong>Rosetta</strong>
						mission's <strong>Philae</strong> lander on
						67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko? The answer is, no way,
						I couldn't! What a truly historic moment. Although the
						landing wasn't without complications, leading to Philae
						running out of energy much earlier than hoped, the
						mission can be considered nothing but a resounding
						success. I recommend you check out
						<a href="http://rosetta.esa.int/" target="_blank">ESA's
						Rosetta page</a>, which has all the details.
					</p>

					<p>
						Space is almost empty. Check out this
						<a
							href="http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html"
							target="_blank">
							tediously accurate map of the solar system
						</a>
						to learn exactly how empty it actually is.
