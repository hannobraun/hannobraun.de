/**
 * This code enables us to run our code both in the browser and in CommonJS environments like node.js.
 * It works by providing a require implementation that works in the browser and a register function that allows
 * modules to register objects, so they can be imported elsewhere using require.

The module must be registered\n  by calling the register function.\n- Please double-check if the module name you require matches the one you used for registering.\n  The String argument you pass to register must be identical to the one passed to require.\n- Is this require error one of several errors? If yes, only fix the first one. The rest might\n  take care of themselves after you did that.\n- Are you sure the module was executed?
